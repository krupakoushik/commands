I made a discord bot and since my wallet is superficial, This is all I could make since github doesnt support server side websites, Well check out my bot and add it to your server :)
You can either go to the website - https://krupakoushik.github.io/cynthia
or you can add it from this link - https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1118220952556286013&permissions=41781441724406&scope=applications.commands%20bot
and also join this super active server ;-; - https://discord.com/invite/TvXvxC7zhM
and yea thats all I have to say :)
